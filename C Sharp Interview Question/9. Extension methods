Extension methods allow existing classes to be extended without relying on inheritance or having to change the class's source code.
If the class is sealed than there in no concept of extending its functionality. For this a new concept is introduced, in other words extension methods.

Example:
      int price = 20;
      price.ToPrice()
 public class Employee
    {
        public static int id { get; set; }
        public static string name { get; set; }
    }
    public static class Comman
    {
        public static string ToPrice(this int value)
        {
            return "$" + value+ ".00";
        }
        public static void ToLowerPrice(this Employee value)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("static method");
        }
    }
