Const Keyword:
==============

Definition:
-----------

1. Const keyword is used to create a field for which the value should not be changed and it remains the same throughout the program.
2. It can be number, string, null or boolean.
3. Compile time constant.

Usage in Code:
--------------
<modifier> const <datatype> <constname>

*Modifier is optional or might depend upon situations.

const should be initialised at the time of declaration.

Example:
--------
class ConstDemo {
 
    // Constant fields
    public const int myvar = 10;
    public const string str = "Hari";
 
    // Main method
    static public void Main()
    {
 
        // Display the value of Constant fields
        Console.WriteLine("The value of myvar: {0}", myvar);
        Console.WriteLine("The value of str: {0}", str);
    }
}


What if cases to the questions:
--------------------------------

What if => I try to change the const value.
		=> Try to use static at the time of declaration.
		=> Try not to initialise at declaration.
		=> Try to use expressions at RHS.

Why not the other alternatives:
--------------------------------

Why not use readonly => refer readonly doc

Need for that concept:
-----------------------

1. To avoid hardcoded logic at various places in program.
2. To make a centralised value which can be accessed from multiple locations.

Other notable points:
----------------------

1. const value cannot be static.

Realtime application of that concept in our project codes:
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Declaring Stored Procedures, table names, parameter names.
2. Hardcoded logics in more than 2 places.
