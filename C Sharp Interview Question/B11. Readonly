readonly Keyword:
==============

Definition: it indicates that assignment to the field can only occur as part of the declaration or in a constructor in the same class. 
A readonly field can be assigned and reassigned multiple times within the field declaration and constructor
-----------



Usage in Code:
--------------
<modifier> const <datatype> <constname>

*Modifier is optional or might depend upon situations.

readonly can be optional at the time of declaration.

Example:
--------
class Age
{
    private readonly int _year;
    Age(int year)
    {
        _year = year;
    }
    void ChangeYear()
    {
        //_year = 1967; // Compile error if uncommented.
    }
}


What if cases to the questions:
--------------------------------

What if => Can't be used with static, if we are re-assigning in Constructor
         => Can't be re-assign in Derived class constructor
         

Why not the other alternatives:
--------------------------------

There is no alternatives

Need for that concept:
-----------------------


Other notable points:
----------------------



Realtime application of that concept in our project codes:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Depedency Injection
