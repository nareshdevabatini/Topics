Class, methods & functions are open to extension and closed for Modifications
  1. Endup testing the entire functionality
  2. Costly process for Organization

 public decimal calculateBonus( string type){
    if(type == 'Permannent'){
     return employeeSalary * 10%
     }
     else if(type === 'contract')
      return employeeSalary * 5%;
      }
  }
  
 As per above example, we need to modify all the condition for new employee or need to add new condition
 and test the whole method
 
public abstract class employee{
  int id;
  string name;
  decimal employeeSalary;
  public abstract decimal calculateBonus();
 }
 
public class PermanentEmployee: Employee{
  public override calculateBonus(){
    return employeeSal * 10%;
  }
}

public class ContractEmployee: Employee{
  public override calculateBonus(){
    return employeeSal * 5%;
  }
}
