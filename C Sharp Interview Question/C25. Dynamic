It is a is used to declare a variable that can hold values of any data type at runtime.  
This means that the type of a dynamic variable is not known at compile time but is determined at runtime.

Example1: 
    dynamic dynamicVariable;
    dynamicVariable = 42; // Assign an integer
    Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable); 
    dynamicVariable = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 }; // Assign a List of integers
    Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable.Count);
 In Above example, I can add any type to dynamic variable after assignment also.

Example2: 
    dynamic jsonData = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonString);
    string name = jsonData.Name;
    int age = jsonData.Age;
  It'll work with serialize data and directly can use inside variable data.

Example3: 
    dynamic comObject = GetCOMObject();
    comObject.DoSomething();
  It'll work with COM objects as well.
