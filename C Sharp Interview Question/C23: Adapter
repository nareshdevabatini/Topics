Adapter: A class needs to be reused which doesn't have an interface or where class adapts base class method and creating interface for derived class.
We needs to used existing class without changing it.

In base class, we are returning String of XMLDocument in Adapter class(derived class), we are converting XMLdocument to business class modal.

using System.Xml;

public class EmployeeService
{
   public string getEmployeList() { return new XmlDocument().InnerXml; }
   public string getEmploye() { return new XmlDocument().InnerXml; }
   public void UpdateEmployee(string employe) { }
}
public interface IEmployeeAdapter
{
    Employee getEmployeList();
}
public class EmployeeAdapter: EmployeeService, IEmployeeAdapter
{
    public new Employee getEmployeList()
    {
       var employee = base.getEmployeList();
        return new Employee();
    } 
}
public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
