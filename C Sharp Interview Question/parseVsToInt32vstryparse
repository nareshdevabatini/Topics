Parse: It'll throw an exception while converting other then integer values
       Advantages: it'll be little bit faster, if we are using multiple loops
 
ToInt32: It'll work for Null and integer values, otherthen that it'll throw an exception

TryParse: It'll return false if data is not an integer.

Syntax:
            int a;
            bool b = int.TryParse("23", out a);
            Console.WriteLine(b);
            Console.WriteLine(a);
            Console.ReadLine();
            Output: false
                     23
