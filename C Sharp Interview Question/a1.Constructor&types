Constructor is special method in a class which gets automatically invoked when we instance of that class.

Some of the key points regarding the Constructor are:
  A class can have any number of constructors.
  A constructor doesn't have any return type, not even void.
  A static constructor can not be a parametrized constructor.
  Within a class you can create only one static constructor. 

Constructors can be divided into 5 types:
1. Default Constructor: with same class name without parameter
2. Parametrized Constructor: It contains parameter , when intialize we have to pass parameter
3. Copy Constructor: 
4. Static Constructor: Without parameter, Accessmodifier and it contains only one static constructor and compiler will call without instance
5. Private Constructor: It'll be use on normal class with private access modifier constructor, and all method of inside the class be use 
                        static keyword
