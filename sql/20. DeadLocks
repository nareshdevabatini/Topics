Whenever we run Begin Transaction and execute update command, if we update same table without completing commit transaction then deadlock will occur for the table
It'll not release the table until first transaction got complete.

Window 1
Begin Transaction
	update employees set employeeName = 'Keenu' where EmployeeID = 2 
  //Run above code only
	Commit Transaction

 Window 2
 update employees set employeeName = 'Keenu' where EmployeeID = 2
