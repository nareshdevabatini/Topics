What is difference between Use, Run , Next

First we should get IApplicationBuilder, it contains use & run properties

1. RUN: it allows to complete a middleware execution that means it'll terminate the request pipelint.

2. USE: it allows to add a new middleware component and it'll call next sequence middleware component in request pipeline.

3. Next : If we want to run next middleware then we have to call next method from first component.

Example1: 
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Use Middleware1 Incoming Request \n");
            await next();
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Use Middleware1 Outgoing Response \n");
        });
        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Use Middleware2 Incoming Request \n");
            await next();
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Use Middleware2 Outgoing Response \n");
        });
        app.Run(async context => {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Run Middleware3 Request Handled and Response Generated\n");
        });
    }
